Riding a bike is fun?

00:00:04.642 --> 00:00:07.298
But did you ever ride
on a road full of holes?

00:00:07.782 --> 00:00:08.532
Or cars?

00:00:08.657 --> 00:00:09.493
Or both?

00:00:09.899 --> 00:00:11.415
That's not nice.

00:00:12.603 --> 00:00:16.228
The province of East Flanders
asked us to create a mapping tool,

00:00:16.454 --> 00:00:17.985
based on OpenStreetMap,

00:00:18.138 --> 00:00:20.701
where you and the towns of East-Flanders,

00:00:20.740 --> 00:00:24.919
can add, edit and overview 
all bicycle routes!

00:00:25.411 --> 00:00:28.724
This will allow cyclists to
reference bike friendly lanes,

00:00:28.826 --> 00:00:30.303
directly from their phone,

00:00:30.622 --> 00:00:35.341
and the towns will know exactly
where to improve their bike infrastructure.

00:00:36.857 --> 00:00:41.372
Thanks to our amazing team, you can now
complete the data, using simple questions,

00:00:41.568 --> 00:00:43.443
view all the dangers on the map,

00:00:44.068 --> 00:00:46.693
split the roads and so much more!

00:00:47.328 --> 00:00:51.555
Wow, riding a bike in
East-Flanders will be better than ever!

00:00:52.023 --> 00:00:53.484
Do you have any more questions?

00:00:53.719 --> 00:00:56.844
Please come visit us at our
Bike repair café ☕🎵

00:00:57.125 --> 00:00:58.234

00:00:58.259 --> 00:00:59.445

Bye!
